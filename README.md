Project 1 is due on September 6th by 11:59 pm.

Project questions in the `Project1.pdf` file.

You must push your local repository back to GitHub before the deadline.
Your repository must contain the Matlab code you used to complete the project, including a `main.m` file that should generate all plots when executed, and a `report.pdf` file with your answers to the project questions.
